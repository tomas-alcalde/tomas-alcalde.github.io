Welcome to my website :) 

I'm a third-year PhD student in Mathematics at TU Wien, supervised by [Nathanaël Berestycki](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/nathanael.berestycki/), [Marcin Lis](https://sites.google.com/view/marcin-lis/home) and [Avelio Sepúlveda](https://www.dim.uchile.cl/~lsepulveda/). My main interests are Probability Theory and Statistical Mechanics. In particular, my research focuses on two-dimensional spin models at criticality and their connection to the Gaussian free field. 

See also the [Probability group of TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/mg/proba/team) or the wider [Probability community in Vienna](https://sites.google.com/view/probabilityinvienna/home)

**Note**: Please mind that "Alcalde López" are *both* surnames, and I would really appreciate it if you could cite them as such. You can download a Bibtex citation in the Publications tab!
